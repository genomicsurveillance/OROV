# Rapid Viral Expansion Beyond the Amazon Basin: Increased Epidemic Activity of Oropouche Virus Across the Americas
Oropouche virus (OROV), first detected in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955, was historically confined to the Brazilian Amazon Basin. However, since late 2022, OROV has been reported in northern Brazil as well as urban centers in Bolivia, Colombia, Cuba, and Peru. In collaboration with Central Public Health Laboratories across Brazil, we integrated epidemiological metadata with genomic analyses from recent cases. This led to the generation of 133 whole genome sequences covering the virus’s three genomic segments (L, M, and S), including the first genomes from regions outside the Amazon and from the first recorded fatal cases. The 2024 OROV genomes form a monophyletic group in the phylogenetic tree with sequences from the Amazon Basin sampled since 2022. Our analyses revealed a rapid north-to-south viral movement into historically non-endemic areas. We identified 21 reassortment events, though it remains unclear if genomic evolution has enabled the virus to adapt to local ecological conditions or develop phenotypes of public health significance. These data demonstrate how the virus evolved via reassortment and spread rapidly across multiple states in Brazil, causing the largest outbreak ever recorded outside the Amazon and the first confirmed deaths. This work underscores the urgent need for heightened epidemiological and genomic surveillance, alongside measures to mitigate viral transmission and its impacts. The recent rapid geographic expansion and the emergence of fatal cases emphasize the importance of enhanced surveillance across the Americas. Without significant changes in the human population over the past two years, viral adaptation, deforestation, and recent climate shifts—either individually or in combination—may have driven Oropouche virus beyond the Amazon Basin.
